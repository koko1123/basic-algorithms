# mooc-homework
Files containing standalone scripts I wrote for homework assignments in MOOCs
Also includes canonical implementations of the algorithms used to solve homework problems.
I expect to use this as reference when further solving problems on Hackkerrank/Topcoder/Leetcode and therefore have placed an emphasis on readability.
