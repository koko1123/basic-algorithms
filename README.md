# basic-algorithms
Files containing standalone scripts I wrote for homework assignments and to better understand python 3.x.
Also includes canonical implementations of the underlying algorithms used to solve those homework problems.
Emphasis on readability, but uses canonical (pythonic) techniqies for non standard sub-problems.
